## Description
Dance & Movement is considered one of the most beautiful, natural, and inspiring mediums to humans. Not only is it a form of self-expression but used to communicate with one another. It is considered a universal language that people around the world understand and relate to.

Our vision is to take this language and extend it with the power of computers. Computer coding is often regarded as a powerful tool, but it also has great creative potential. Combining these two self-expressive, yet vastly different types of languages can manifest into something beautiful, familiar, and new all at the same time.

Movement transforms from one movement to the next and builds upon previous layers.  Viewers are invited to express themselves through movement and watch as it unfolds through many layers, translating from one form to another.  We are interested in seeing how everything will unfold, what movement is born from this? How would it inspire a Dancer? A child? A couple? Our goal is to connect with the viewers and promote their self expression.  

Movement uses LEDs, projections and motion sensors to connect the movement of a subject with computer generated art. <Title> is a process, a journey, starting from nothing, and building into a final piece of art. Each movement building upon the previous, progressing through various levels of imagery. Each medium acts as a different layer of expression from the subject.  Dance and movement only last in a moment of time, but by extending it with the aid of technology, we can capture it in a final complete piece of art.
