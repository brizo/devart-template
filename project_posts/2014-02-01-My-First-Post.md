Concept Design:

We have been going back and forth between how to integrate both the wall projection and the LEDs.  We ran some simulations and had to re-evaluate how we wanted to approach our concept.  

A few things that came up were:
1) Contrast to highlight one or the other
2) Bounce back and forth between the wall and LED 
3) Use the LED to highlight motion and the projection to showcase the final "art piece"
