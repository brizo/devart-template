Audio Control

We decided to add another level to the project by adding an audio reactive component.  We used the [Synapse](http://synapsekinect.tumblr.com/post/6307790318/synapse-for-kinect) "Synapse" in order to track the user via Kinect, Max patches to convert the Kinect data, and Ableton to play the music. 

The vertical position of the right hand controls an arpeggio that is synced in time and scale.  An arpeggio provides constant interaction as well as constant playing, so the user feels control without having to worry about being on beat or messing up the music.

The vertical position of the left hand controls the equalizer, allowing the user to have control over the low, mid, and high frequencies. This gives the user a sense of musical depth.
