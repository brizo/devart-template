Concept Design:

We have two areas of focus right now: 
1) How we want to draw to the screen and tie all the layers together
2) How to best represent motion in the LEDs

When everything is done, the final image is uploaded to Flickr to be shared with the world.


We tried out a few things with the LED simulation and came up with a few ways that we wanted to represent and promote movement.  

- Movements compound and build upon the previous movements, and we show this by making the LED's brighter as the subject moves more, but as soon as movement slows down, the LEDs dim.  The idea is to promote more movement.  
- Light an orb in the LEDs to represent the subject, and pulsate a wave around the orb with each piece of movement and optionally with the beat of music.  The orb would also move as the subject moves.  The idea is to tie the user into the experience of the LEDs.  
- And as we show in the video below, we wanted to also extend the depth of the screen that's being painted and re-draw what was on the screen on each layer of LEDs.

Canvas - 3 Layers total

Movement triggers 2 Layers:
1) Triggers change in the background base layer (geometric shapes)
2) Draws 1-to-1 painting

3rd Layer:
Image of the subjects face.  The face is untouched or masked, the hair is masked and modified and changes to movement or dance.  

As far as the drawing with motion, we want to try a few concepts.  Here are some images that we are inspired by:

- Paint Splatter

- Whorechata - (http://www.willowiswatching.com/Magic-Show)

- Incorporating their face, utilizing delauny triangulation for different parts of the head (hair, face, eyes, etcâ€¦).  (http://www.creativeapplications.net/openframeworks/squeal-ipad-openframeworks/)
